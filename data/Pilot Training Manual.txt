SIMULATOR AND FLIGHT TRAINING
Pilot performance during simulator and flight training shall be graded as: Proficient (1), Normal
Progress (2), Additional Training Required (3), Unsatisfactory (4), or Discussed (D).
The criteria for grading shall be as follows:
¢ Proficient (1)—The pilot is able to easily perform the procedure or maneuver and is the
obvious master of the aircraft, with the successful outcome of the maneuver never in doubt.
¢« Normal Progress (2)—The pilot is making satisfactory progress toward proficiency in the
procedure or maneuver but still requires assistance from the instructor. However, the in-
structor is satisfied that, with additional practice as provided in the standard syllabus, the
pilot will become fully proficient in the maneuver or procedure.
¢ Additional Training Required (3)—The pilot’s progress is not satisfactory. However, the
instructor is of the opinion that additional training over and above that specified in the
syllabus will enable the pilot to become proficient.
¢ Unsatisfactory (4)—The pilot shows basic deficiencies, such as lack of knowledge, skill,
or ability to perform the required procedures or maneuvers. If the present level of per-
formance or progress is maintained, it is doubtful that the pilot will become proficient.
Further training shall be given only after review by the Center Manager.
¢ Discussed (D)—This designation indicates that the item was discussed and not performed
in the simulator or aircraft. The discussion revealed a satisfactory knowledge of the ap-
propriate procedure, aircraft system, etc.
¢ Trained (T)—Trained in maneuvers for procedures only, no flight training credit taken.
Simulator and Flight Training—The pilot is required to achieve a grade of | (proficient) by the
completion of training. Additional training will be provided in the portion of the flight in which
the pilot experienced difficulty. Decision to terminate training for a pilot who demonstrates sub-
standard performance will be made by the Center Manager.
COMPLETION STANDARDS
The pilot must demonstrate through written examination and simulator/flight practical tests that
he/she meets the qualification standards for each segment of the course:
e Aircraft Ground Training—The pilot must demonstrate adequate knowledge of the
Challenger series airplane to pass a written final exam with a minimum passing grade of
70% corrected to 100%.
¢ Simulator/Flight Training—The pilot will meet the standards of the Airline Transport Pilot
and Type Rating Practical Test Standards (FAA-S-8081-5).

The Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16, model CL601-3A/R has an electrical system that
is comparable to that of a modern airliner. It was the first business jet to have a primary
electrical system based on AC power. The 115-VAC system is lighter and more reliable for
a given power output than DC-based systems.
Twenty-eight Volts DC is derived from the AC system through the use of transformer-
rectifier units (TRU).
A battery is provided for APU starting and emergency DC backup.

AC external power is supplied through a stan-

the right-hand nose section of the fuselage
(Figure 2-7). An external power monitor en-
sures that the external AC power is safe and
within specified limits before power is ap-
plied to the airplane buses (Figure 2-8). If the
parameters of phase rotation, frequency (400
+ 25 Hz), and voltage (115 + 9 VAC) are sat-
isfactory, the monitor causes a green AVAIL
light to illuminate on the electrical power sec-
tion of the overhead panel. Provided no other
airplane generator is on line, movement of the
G PWR switch to the ON position extinguishes
the AVAIL light and illuminates the amber IN
USE light. This indicates that external AC
power is now connected to the airplane buses.
If the APU generator or any main generator is
brought on line, external power automatically
reverts to an available status.

The emergency AC power system provides ”
115-/200-volt, 3-phase, 400-Hz AC power au-
tomatically in flight in the event of loss of all a
primary and auxiliary AC power. The air-
driven generator (ADG) is stowed in a com-
partment on the right side of the nose (Figure * :
2-10) and can be deployed either automatically
or manually. Once deployed, the ADG cannot x
be retracted until the airplane is on the ground.
When deployed, the ADG provides power di-
rectly to the ADG bus. ADG power is rated at
15 kva and is controlled through a GCU also
rated at 15 kva.

The Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16, model CL-601-3A fuel system provides fuel
for the two turbofan engines, as well as the auxiliary power unit (APU). Fuel is also used
to cool the APU generator adapter oil and the main engine oil.

CROSSFLOW VALVE
Should a main tank fuel imbalance occur in
flight for any reason, it can be corrected by
opening the crossflow valve (see Figure 5-2
or 5-3) which connects both main tanks and
both collector tanks. Balance is achieved
through gravity flow only. To avoid a serious
imbalance which might occur if the wings are
not level, the crossflow should not be left open
when the airplane is on the ground.

This chapter deals with the auxiliary power unit (APU) installed as standard equipment
on the Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16, model CL-601-3A/R. The APU renders the
airplane completely independent of such ground servicing requirements as electrical power,
pneumatic power for engine starting, and an air supply for the environmental systems.

APR controller and verifies that the APR system
is operational. To perform the test, the APR
switch is armed. Advance both thrust levers to

READY light came on at 79% N,). The APR
controller samples the fan rpm continuously to
determine if they are stable; that is, fan rpm does
not vary more than a predetermined amount. The
dynamic test initiates an APR trigger to both
APR amplifiers which causes both engines to
accelerate slightly. If the test is valid, the TEST

INTRODUCTION
The Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16, model CL-601-3A/R fire protection system pro-
vides the means for detecting and extinguishing fires in the engines and auxiliary power
unit. It may be considered as two systems, a fire detection system and a fire-extinguishing
system. The fire detection system consists of three separate sensing loops (one for each
engine and the APU) which provide visual and aural warnings for detected fires. The
fire-extinguishing system consists of three bottles (two for the engines and one for the
APU) that are activated from the cockpit. The two engine fire bottles are interconnected
so that both bottles may be used for either engine.
The main landing gear bay is provided with a similar detection system that senses an
overheat condition and provides a cockpit indication.
The jet pipe/pylon overheat detection system gives the crew a visual indication of an
overheat or fire in the jet pipe (exhaust) and pylon areas of the engines.
A portable fire extinguisher suitable for all classes of fires is mounted in the cockpit.
The airplane is also equipped with a bleed-air leak detection system described in
Chapter 9, “Pneumatics.”

Figure 9-7 illustrates that the pneumatic sys- .

the airflow to the affected air turbine starter. Figure 9-6. External Air Supply Adapter
The external supply can also be used for air

this case, the isolation switch, bleed-air

The Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B16, model CL-601-3A/R is equipped with both ice
detection and anti-icing systems. The ice detection system warns the pilots of potential
ice accumulation before it becomes visible on any airplane components. The anti-icing
systems prevent ice accumulation on engine components, wings, windshields, and the
air data system (ADS) probes.
The empennage does not require anti-icing. The airplane does not require, and is not
equipped with, windshield wipers.

Failure of any of the other five heaters is in-
dicated by illumination of the HTR FAIL light
on the ADS heater control panel.

Illumination of either PITOT HEAT light or
the HTR FAIL light is accompanied by illu-
mination of the ANTI-ICE annunciator and the

When the HTR FAIL light illuminates, the ro-
tary PWR & METER SELECT switch must be
rotated through each position until the failed
heater is detected by reference to the % HTR
CURRENT meter. When the meter pointer
falls into the red zone (less than 40%), it shows
that the selected heater is faulty.

All failure indications, except those associ-
ated with the pitot-static probes, may be can-
celed by pressing the HTR FAIL switchlight.
Failure warning for the pitot-static probes can-
not be canceled.

Resetting the HTR FAIL switchlight allows it
to indicate another failure if it occurs.

From here on, the operation of the right ACU

is identical. From the ACU valve, the hot bleed
air passes through the precooler. The WOW
system has opened the jet pump (ejector) valve,
inducing ambient air from the ram-air intake
through the precooler and heat exchangers.
From the precooler, the flow will be through
the primary heat exchanger and then to the
ACU compressor where a pressure and tem-
perature increase occurs. Outflow from the
ACU compressor is directed through the sec-
ondary heat exchanger where temperature is
reduced but pressure is not. This airflow is then
directed through the expansion turbine where
expansion and cooling occurs. The air passes
through the water separator and on to the tem-
perature control system. Here, mixing of hot
air and cold air results in conditioned air at a
selected temperature. This conditioned air is

This chapter deals with the pressurization system of the Canadair Challenger CL-600-
2B16, model CL-601-3A. Chapter 11 described the controlled inflow of air to the oc-
cupied areas of the airplane and the conditioning of that air supply to achieve and
maintain the desired temperatures. Pressurization, on the other hand, is achieved by con-
trolling the outflow of the conditioned air to the atmosphere, but at a rate that will
achieve and maintain selected or preprogrammed cabin altitudes throughout the com-
plete operating envelope of the airplane. Pressurization also ensures complete changes
of air volume at regular intervals, adding greatly to passenger comfort.

GENERAL
Anemergency depressurization system is avail-
able to provide rapid decompression of the air-
plane when an emergency such as air
contamination, cabin fire, or failure of the max-
imum differential control occurs (other situations
may also require emergency depressurization).

CONTROL

The emergency depressurization system is
controlled by a guarded switchlight on the
pressurization control panel (Figure 12-1) la-
beled “EMER DEPRESS.” When pushed, an
amber ON light in the switch will illuminate,
and battery bus voltage will be applied to the
electro-pneumatic (left) outflow valve. Con-
trol pressure in both outflow valves will dis-
sipate rapidly. Both outflow valves will open
and the cabin will depressurize very rapidly.
(At 13,000 +500 feet the altitude limiter will
take over to prevent further cabin climb as
long as there is a source of pressurizing air.)

This chapter deals with the pressurization system of the Canadair Challenger CL-600-
2B16, model CL-601-3R. Chapter 11 described the controlled inflow of air to the oc-
cupied areas of the airplane and the conditioning of that air supply to achieve and
maintain the desired temperatures. Pressurization, on the other hand, is achieved by con-
trolling the outflow of the conditioned air to the atmosphere, but at a rate that will
achieve and maintain selected or preprogrammed cabin altitudes throughout the com-
plete operating envelope of the airplane. Pressurization also ensures complete changes
of air volume at regular intervals, adding greatly to passenger comfort.

the cabin altitude to approximately 13,000

to the full open position. This condition will

prevail until the thrust levers are advanced

beyond the 35° thrust lever quadrant position

which equates to approximately 80% N1 rpm.

Then the automatic selector will signal the

left outflow valve to close (the right outflow

valve is slaved to the left and will also close),

and a predetermined cabin pressure buildup (at

a controlled rate) will occur. This tends to

eliminate pressure surges after lift-off.

Following lift-off, the WOW system will go

to the flight mode and normal pressurization

Normal pressurization scheduling for landing

is field elevation minus 200-300 feet.

Therefore, the airplane lands slightly pres-

surized. When the WOW system goes to the

ground mode, the automatic selector sched-

ules outflow valve opening at the selected

rate of depressurization.

MAIN LANDING GEAR ell
The main landing gear consists of a main beam _ ‘
that is connected to the wing structure, a trail-
ing link with an axle and main wheels, a shock i
strut connecting the main beam to the trailing .
link, and a hydraulic actuator (Figure 14-4). im
— =
The actuator functions as a side brace when the ——
gear is extended. It also incorporates an inte-
gral downlock mechanism that automatically
engages at extension. It can be unlocked only s
with hydraulic pressure on the retract side of
the actuator. -
A mechanical uplock engages the gear at
retraction; it is hydraulically unlocked for
gear extension. E

When retracted, each main gear is partially en-
closed by a door that is mechanically linked
to the main landing gear and actuated by gear

INTRODUCTION
This chapter deals with the flight controls of the Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B 16, model
CL-601-3A/R. The hydraulically powered primary flight control surfaces are operated
by pilot inputs from the control columns, control wheels, and rudder pedals. The flight
controls can also be operated by dual autopilot controls for automatic flight guidance
and yaw stability.
Trim in the pitch, roll, and yaw axes is electrically actuated. There are no trim tabs on
any control surface. Trimming is accomplished by varying the loads on the mechanical
linkages between the pilot and the control surface.
A lift modulation system consists of electrically actuated flaps and hydraulically pow-
ered flight and ground spoilers.
A stall protection system warns of impending stalls by visual, aural, and tactile means.
If no pilot action is taken, it activates a stick pusher.

This chapter describes the crew oxygen system for pilots. Cabin oxygen systems for pas-
sengers are installed by the modification centers and are not standardized. Pilots must
have a thorough knowledge of the cabin oxygen system installed on their airplane be-
fore flight with passengers.
The Canadair Challenger CL-600-2B 16, model CL-601-3A/R is equipped with a demand-
type crew oxygen system for crewmembers’ supplemental oxygen. A single steel cylin-
der stores oxygen at high pressure. Oxygen is supplied to the crew through regulators and
masks. The system has the capability for life support at cabin altitudes above 35,000 feet
under emergency conditions.
The oxygen cylinder is located in the right oxygen cylinder pressure in the cockpit and
forward fuselage and stores high-pressure on the ground service panel. A green over-
